# ErrorCorrectionMemoryPathFinal
This is a VHDL project for my Computer Architecture and Organization Lab. The project is presented at the end of the semester. As the name suggests, it's about Error-Correction Memory Path. Made by Xilinx 14.7.

Note that only the .vhd files contain the actual VHDL code.
